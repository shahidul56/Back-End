# Bookr - Back-End

Bookr is your source for all things Text Book. Picture the AirBNB of text books, a social platform for peer reviewed text books.

Bookr URL: https://bookr-bw.herokuapp.com

MVP: As a user I can log in, and see a list of text books. Each book will have a 5 star rating I can browse from. As a user I can review each book.

- Login Page - After a user logs in, they'll be directed to a home page.

- Navigation - Navigation is present on all pages, Users should know what page is active by clicking on a nav link and activating their tab.

- Home Page - Contains a list of Books laid out in a grid format.

- Single Book Page - Loads information about the book, Author, Name, Publisher and a scrolling list of reviews. Add review and delete book buttons present.

- Single Book Add Review Page - Clicking add review brings up a form (could be modal, could be its own page) where a user can add their review of the book. Clicking submit adds the review to the books information.

- Delete Book - Modal confirming the action, on confirmation user is routed back to the home page and book is gone from the list of books.

Stretch Goal: A link to each book will take me to a site where I can purchase a book and compare prices.
